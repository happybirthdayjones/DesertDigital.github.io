	<p>	There are many issues that arise with Machine Learning (ML). The neural network needs to be
		carefully examined when training data. Errors occur when the data is not properly being managed. For example 
		a Neural Network analyzing countries would not properly distingish the differences between "US" and "us".
		It should be noted that collecting data to train is both hard and cost effective, 
		so the user needs to appropriatley identify an algorithm with an appropriate time complexity.
